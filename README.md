# Scoop Bucket

[![Tests](https://github.com/quardbreak/scoop-bucket/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/quardbreak/scoop-bucket/actions/workflows/ci.yml) [![Excavator](https://github.com/quardbreak/scoop-bucket/actions/workflows/excavator.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/quardbreak/scoop-bucket/actions/workflows/excavator.yml)

This is my personal bucket with some manifests I made for myself, or took from the upstream in order to modify for my own purposes.

## How do I install manifests from here?

```
scoop bucket add quardbreak https://github.com/quardbreak/scoop-bucket
scoop install quardbreak/<manifestname>
```
